It can affect any joint, but it most commonly affects the knees, hips, hands, and spine. OA is a degenerative disease, meaning it worsens over time, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<h3 style=font-size:20px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:8px>Causes and Risk Factors</h3><p style=font-size:16px;margin-bottom:12px>Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Several factors can increase the risk of developing OA, including:<ul style=margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:12px><li style=font-size:16px>Age: The risk increases as you get older.<li style=font-size:16px>Genetics: Family history can play a role in OA development.<li style=font-size:16px>Injury: Previous joint injuries increase the likelihood of OA.<li style=font-size:16px>Obesity: Excess weight puts more stress on weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips.</ul><h3 style=font-size:20px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:8px>Symptoms</h3><p style=font-size:16px;margin-bottom:12px>Common symptoms of osteoarthritis include:<ul style=margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:12px><li style=font-size:16px>Joint pain, especially after movement or use.<li style=font-size:16px>Stiffness in the affected joints, especially in the morning.<li style=font-size:16px>Reduced flexibility or range of motion in the joint.<li style=font-size:16px>Swelling or tenderness in the joint.</ul><h3 style=font-size:20px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:8px>Treatment Options</h3><p style=font-size:16px;margin-bottom:12px>While osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, several treatments can help manage its symptoms:<ul style=margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:12px><li style=font-size:16px>Medications: Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs help reduce pain and swelling.<li style=font-size:16px>Physical therapy: Exercises can help strengthen muscles around the joint and improve flexibility.<li style=font-size:16px>Lifestyle changes: Weight management and low-impact exercises can reduce joint stress.<li style=font-size:16px>Surgery: In severe cases, joint replacement surgery may be necessary.</ul><h3 style=font-size:20px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:8px>Managing Osteoarthritis</h3><p style=font-size:16px;margin-bottom:12px>Although there is no cure for OA, there are ways to manage the condition effectively:<ul style=margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:12px><li style=font-size:16px>Regular exercise to keep joints flexible and maintain muscle strength.<li style=font-size:16px>Using assistive devices like braces or canes to reduce joint strain.<li style=font-size:16px>Applying hot or cold packs to reduce pain and stiffness.</ul><h3 style=font-size:20px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:8px>Consult a Healthcare Provider</h3><p style=font-size:16px;margin-bottom:12px>If you're experiencing joint pain or stiffness, consult a healthcare provider to discuss potential treatment options.

When conservative treatments like orthotics and pain relief no longer help, surgical correction—called a <em>bunionectomy</em>—may be recommended to relieve discomfort and restore normal foot alignment.</p><h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;">When Is Surgery Necessary?</h2><p style="font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Bunion surgery becomes necessary when the pain interferes with daily activities, footwear no longer fits comfortably, or the deformity continues to worsen. A foot and ankle specialist will evaluate the bunion\'s severity through physical exam and X-rays.</p><h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;">Types of Bunion Surgery</h2><ul style="margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: disc;"><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Osteotomy:</strong> The bone is cut and realigned to straighten the toe.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Exostectomy:</strong> The bony bump is shaved off without correcting the alignment (rarely done alone).</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Arthrodesis:</strong> Fusing the joint in severe cases, typically for arthritis-related bunions.</li></ul><h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;">What to Expect After Surgery</h2><p style="font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Recovery varies depending on the type of procedure, but typically involves:</p><ul style="margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: disc;"><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Wearing a surgical boot or shoe</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Rest and limited weight-bearing</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Physical therapy to regain mobility</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Full recovery in 6–12 weeks</li></ul><p style="margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1.1em; font-style: italic; color: #666;">Modern bunion surgery is more refined than ever, with many patients returning to normal activities pain-free and with improved foot alignment.</p></div>',

      'Earlobe repair is a procedure to correct, reshape or rejuvenate the lowest portion of the ear. Your physician makes an incision just above the tear or stretched-out area of the lobe, trims off excess tissue and reshapes the area. Very fine stitches are used to close the incision in layers and complete the procedure.',

It involves inserting a small camera, called an arthroscope, into the joint through a tiny incision.

The arthroscope, which has a light and camera, is inserted, and images are projected onto a monitor. Additional instruments may be used through other incisions to repair or remove damaged tissue.</p><h2 style=\"color: #444; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;\">Common Joints Treated</h2><ul style=\"margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Knee</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Shoulder</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Elbow</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Wrist</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Ankle</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Hip</li></ul><h2 style=\"color: #444; font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;\">Benefits of Arthroscopy</h2><ul style=\"margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Less pain and scarring</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Faster recovery</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Reduced risk of complications</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">Shorter hospital stays</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1.1em; font-style: italic; color: #666;\">Arthroscopy is a safe and effective way to both diagnose and treat joint issues—helping patients get back on their feet sooner.</p></div>`,
